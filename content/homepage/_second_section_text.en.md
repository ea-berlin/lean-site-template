## What does EA Berlin do?
EA Berlin is one of  of local EA groups around the globe, and serves as entry point to the community. We connect students and professionals interested in doing good effectively and support them in their personal development and career planning to increase their impact. We organize regular work meetups, discussion groups, workshops (career planning & rationality), career coaching, research projects, talks, networking events and socials. Most of our events are internal, some public. Occasionally, we join the wider EA community at international [conferences](https://www.eaglobal.org/) and on retreats.
